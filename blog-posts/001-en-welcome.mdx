## Introducing myself
Welcome here <span className="inline-block animate-wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>! 

My name is Yamine Daroueche, I am a French student in Computer Science and Web development. I have been studying Computer Science since 2023, at the University of Limoges in France.

Besides that, I am also a travel enthusiast. 

## Purpose of This Blog
As a student in Computer Science, I am aspiring to break into the tech industry by becoming a great Web developer. So I decided to make a blog to document my learning journey, and showcase projects I work on.

It is also a creative space for me to share some thoughts on other subjects, like traveling.

## Tech stack
For the technical aspect of this blog, I decided to use the following tech stack:

#### Main framework: Next.js
Next.js is probably one of the most used framework for Web development. It's not hard to learn it, and there is a lot of documentation and information online about it. Love it or hate it, I personnally choosed Next.js for its convenience.

#### Front-End
- MDX: to write the articles. I find it really handy because it uses Markdown format, which is easier to write than HTML because there is no need for HTML tags everywhere.
- Motion: to handle animations.
- Tailwind CSS: really basic for styling.
- DaisyUI: a Tailwind CSS plugin to enhance the styling options.
- Lucide React: icon library.
- Shiky: for code blocks syntax highlighting. I will use it on the technical articles where I will need to write code directly in the article.

#### Back-End
- Node.js: to handle the back-end.
- Next-intl: to handle localisation of the website (which currently English and French).
- Upstash: to handle the database of the blog.

## The categories of articles
The blog posts will mainly be written on my learnings and discoveries in my journey to become a Web developer.

However, I will also write on other subjects every now and then. 

I travel a lot in the year, so I will share my traveling experiences, the destinations, and some pictures.

## Final words
Thank you for having read my first ever blog post! I hope that you enjoyed reading it.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback.
