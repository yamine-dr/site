This is the first article of my blog!

In this article, I will share the purpose of this blog and how it is built:
- Who I am, what I do
- Why I decided to create this blog, how it is built (the tech stack)
- The categories of articles I will write
{/* In a future update: how readers can contribute to it (comments, suggestions, feedback) */}

## Introducing myself
Welcome here <span className="inline-block animate-wave">üëã</span>! 

My name is Yamine Daroueche, I am a 21 year-old French guy. I am a student in Computer Science and Web development. I have been studying Computer Science since 2023, at the University of Limoges in France.

Besides that, I am also an amateur football (soccer) player, and a travel enthusiast. 

## Purpose of This Blog and tech stack
As a student in Computer Science, I am aspiring to break into the tech industry by becoming a great Web developer. So I decided to make a blog to document my learning journey, and showcase projects I work on. It is also a creative space for me to share some thoughts and experiences, on traveling, football, and other subjects.

For the technical aspect of this blog, I decided to use the following tech stack, with Next.js as the framework:
<div id="tech-stack" className="flex">
{/* 
{TechIcons["Next.js"]} {TechIcons["MDX"]} {TechIcons["Tailwind CSS"]} {TechIcons["CSS"]} {TechIcons["Shiki"]}
{TechIcons["Upstash"]}
*/}
</div>

#### The Front-End
- MDX: to write articles. I find it really convenient because it uses Markdown format, which is easier to write than HTML because there is no need for HTML tags everywhere.
- Shiky: for code blocks syntax highlighting. I will use it on the technical articles where I will need to write code directly in the article.
- Tailwind CSS and CSS: really basic for styling.

#### The Back-End
- Next.js: main framework of the blog
- Upstash: to store some data for the blog (like the number of views of each blog post).

## The categories of articles
The blog posts will mainly be written on my learnings and discoveries in my journey to become a Web developer.

However, I will also write on other subjects every now and then. 

I travel a lot in the year, so I will share my traveling experiences, the destinations, and some pictures.

## Concept du blog

C'est aussi un espace cr√©atif pour moi dans lequel je peux m'exercer √† l'√©criture.
